============

derbylisting.com website

DerbyListing.com is a website that lists all of the active roller derby leagues, teams, and groups around the world.

The idea is to make it a little easier for people interested in roller derby to find a local group that they can join.

I'm not a web designer, nor am I a programmer.  The site is built using off the shelf and open source tools available just about anywhere.

jquery
jqgrid
javascript
php
mysql

This repository is just my place to store and share the files I use for the site.  Again, I'm not a programmer, so my code is likely very poorly done.

Don't laugh... too hard.  ;)
